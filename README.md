## üéôÔ∏è Audio Transcription Web App Powered by Faster Whisper

WhisperTranscribe is a user-friendly web application built with Streamlit that leverages the speed and accuracy of Faster Whisper, an optimized implementation of OpenAI's Whisper model, to transcribe audio files to text. This tool provides a simple interface for uploading audio files, transcribing them, and exporting the results in different formats.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Multi-format Audio Support**: Transcribe MP3, WAV, and M4A audio files
- **Model Selection**: Choose from various Whisper model sizes (tiny, base, small, medium, large-v2)
- **Hardware Optimization**: Select between CPU and GPU processing (when available)
- **Precision Control**: Fine-tune performance with different compute precision options
- **Language Detection**: Automatic language detection or manual selection for improved accuracy
- **Export Options**: Save transcriptions as text files or formatted PDFs
- **User-friendly Interface**: Clean, responsive design with progress indicators and error handling

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/whispertranscribe.git
   cd whispertranscribe
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
